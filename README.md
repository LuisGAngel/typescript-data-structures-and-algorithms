# README

## Introduction
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of various algorithms and data structures, implemented as a part of an educational initiative. The primary objective is to facilitate a deeper understanding of these fundamental concepts through hands-on experience.

## Content
The repository encompasses a wide range of algorithms and data structures, each implemented with the intent of learning and experimentation. These implementations serve as practical examples that illustrate the theory behind these essential computer science concepts.

## Educational Purpose
The content of this repository is strictly for educational purposes. It provides a platform for learners to study, understand, and experiment with different algorithms and data structures. It is a resource for those who wish to delve into the intricacies of these concepts and learn from practical implementation.

## Code Optimization
It's important to note that the algorithms and data structures present in this repository are not optimized for production use. While they accurately represent the concepts, they may lack the efficiency or robustness that would be required in a production environment.

## Language
The majority of the code within this repository is written in Typescript. Typescript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript, provides a suitable environment for implementing and understanding these concepts due to its clear syntax and strong typing system.
